# Detecting Gene Expression Signatures

**Gregory Way 2019**

In this module we perform a series of t-tests to detect sample sex in GTEx samples and TCGA patients as well as MYCN amplification status in neuroblastoma (NBL) tumors using TARGET data.

## Reproducible Analysis

To reproduce the results of the gene expression signature analysis perform the following:

```bash
# Activate computational environment
conda activate biobombe

# Perform the analysis
cd 10.gene-expression-signatures
./signature_analysis.sh
```
