# The purpose of this script is to determine a reasonable set of hyperparameters
# for different input z dimensionality. The ultimate goal is to perform an
# analysis on the latent space dimensionality, and we want to be sure that
# the comparisons being made are not a result of poor input hyperparameters

# The parameters were selected to represent a range of hyperparameters that
# we have previously observed to impact training. Learning rates appear to
# have the largest impact on performance, so we include a larger search space.

# Note this was run at the PMACS cluster at University of Pennsvylvania on a
# cluster of 8 NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX Ti GPUs.
