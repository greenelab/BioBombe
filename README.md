# Interpreting Compressed Gene Expression Features 

**Gregory Way 2018**

**University of Pennsylvania**

The repository stores data and data processing modules to enable compressed gene expression feature interpretation.

## Modules 

To reproduce the results of the analysis, the modules should be run in order.

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| 0.expression-download | Download and process gene expression data to run through pipeline |
| 1.initial-z-sweep | Determine a set of optimal hyperparameters for Tybalt and ADAGE models across a representative range of z dimensionality |
| 2.ensemble-z-analysis | Train various algorithms to compress gene expression data across a large range of z dimensions |
| 3.build-hetnets | Download, process, and integrate various curated gene sets into a single heterogeneous network |

## Algorithms

See [2.ensemble-z-analysis](2.ensemble-z-analysis) for more details.

## Computational Environment

All processing and analysis scripts were performed using the conda environment specified in `environment.yml`.
To build and activate this environment run:

```bash
# conda version 4.5.0
conda env create --force --file environment.yml

conda activate interpret-compression
```
